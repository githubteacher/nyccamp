I’m a Sr. Front End Web Dev and Instructor of web design/development living in Long Island, Ny. As you all would guess, my main focus has been to help create new RWD web products using current web standards that are broken into three layers. The content, presentation and behaviors layer for a cleaner, more semantic and SEO friendlier way. My background can be seen in many accounts such Chanel,Ckone, cablevision, David Yurman, Nikon, Benefit Cosmetics and Levis. Just to name a few of the brands that I have worked with in team sizes varied from 1 to 60 people.

I’m also an ex-member of the USAF and photographer. My some of my current personal passions are focused around creating good food, learning more about SASS, Grunt, Angularjs and Javascript in general and shooting/editing video which my last youtube video has over 15k in views - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE0Gm0e_CrE.
